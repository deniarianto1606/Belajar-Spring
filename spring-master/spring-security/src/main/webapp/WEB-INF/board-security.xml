        Authentication is the process of  verifying a principal's identity against what it claims to be
        A principal can be user, a device or a system, but most typically, its a user
        A principal has to provide evidence of identity to be authenticated. This evidence is called a credential, which is usually a password when the target principal is a user
        Authorization is the process of granting authorities to an authenticated user so that this user is allowed to access particular resource of the target application. The authorization process must be performed after the authentication process. Typically, authorities are granted in terms of roles
        Access control means controlling access toan application resources.
